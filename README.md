> [!IMPORTANT]
> 🎉 **Version 1.0 is Now Live!**
>
> HiAni DL v1.0.0 has been released and is ready for testing! Download the latest Docker image and help us improve the project.
>
> 📦 **[View Release Notes](https://github.com/benjaminmue/HiAni-DL/releases/tag/v1.0.0)** | 📢 **[Read Announcement](https://github.com/benjaminmue/HiAni-DL/discussions/1)** | 🤝 **[We Need Contributors!](https://github.com/benjaminmue/HiAni-DL/discussions/1#user-content-we-need-your-help)**

> [!CAUTION]
> **Known Issues with Multi-Episode Downloads**
>
> This project currently has **reliability issues when downloading multiple episodes**. Downloads may work intermittently - sometimes succeeding, sometimes failing without clear patterns.
>
> **Root Cause:** The current Selenium-based stream capture implementation struggles with parallel episode processing and can hang or fail to extract streams. Initial testing with a Playwright migration did not resolve these issues.
>
> **Recommendation:** For production use, consider downloading episodes **one at a time** or be prepared for occasional failures requiring manual restarts. This project is best suited for **experimental/personal use** until the stream capture logic is stabilized.

## 📖 What is HiAni DL?

HiAni DL is a **Docker-only** anime downloader designed for **local network (LAN) use**. It features a modern web interface with real-time progress tracking and background processing.

> 🏠 **LAN-Only Deployment**
> This application is designed for **private home networks only**. Never expose it directly to the internet without proper security measures.

> 🐳 **Docker Required**
> HiAni DL **only runs in Docker** - no standalone Python installation is supported. All dependencies, Chrome, and ffmpeg are included in the Docker image.

**Key Features:**
- 🌐 **Modern Web Interface** - Dark theme inspired by HiAnime.to
- 🎬 **Full Anime Support** - Episodes, seasons, and ranges
- 📊 **Real-time Progress** - Live updates via Server-Sent Events
- 🎯 **Background Downloads** - Continue after closing browser
- 🐳 **Docker-Ready** - Chrome and ffmpeg included
- 🔧 **Unraid Support** - PUID/PGID mapping

---

> [!NOTE]
> I built this project because I occasionally ran into episodes that weren't available as torrents for my Plex server. Since I've been using HiAnime for a while and like how it works, I focused on creating a downloader specifically for that site.
